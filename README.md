## Welcome to Azure Networking Lab Accelerator

Azure Networking Lab Accelerator is an open source project that provides a **starting point for Azure Networking Engineers to build faster an environment in wich they can test, improve their skills or create POC using Microsoft Enterprise-Class Networking in Azure**. This repository contains several **Functional scenerios ready to be implemented**, in this lab, you will setup and configure virtual networks in a secure hub-and-spoke design. You will also learn how to secure virtual networks by implementing Azure Firewall, network security groups and application security groups, as well as configure route tables on the subnets in your virtual network. Additionally, you will set up access to the virtual network via Azure Bastion and provision a site-to-site VPN connection from another virtual network, providing emulation of hybrid connectivity from an on-premises environment. The idea of this lab has been taken from Microsoft Cloud Workshop library.

## Overview

You have been asked by Woodgrove Financial Services to provision a proof of concept deployment that will be used by the Woodgrove team to gain familiarity with a complex Virtual Networking deployment, including all of the components that enable the solution. Specifically, the Woodgrove team will be learning:
